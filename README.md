# TC-Website

Welcome to the TC-Website repository! This is a website I am developing for a FiveM server called TimelessCity. Built using Next.js, the site serves as a marketing platform to promote the server.

TimelessCity is a non-profit organization, and this website is designed to reflect the community-driven spirit of the server.

## Features

The website currently consists of two main pages:

    Home - Located at /app/page.tsx

    Rules - Located at /app/rules/page.tsx
